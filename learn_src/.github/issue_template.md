GitHub issues are for tracking bugs, not for general discussing like a forum.

If you have a general question to ask, send it to mailing list:

muduo-library@googlegroups.com

Or visit:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/muduo-library

When file an issue muduo, please provide a [SSCCE](http://sscce.org):
Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example.

If you can't compile muduo, make sure you install `cmake` and `boost` from the
official package repository, e.g. `apt` or `yum`, before opening a bug.
Don't open a bug if you installed boost from a third-party source or
downloaded it by yourself, and couldn't compile muduo, thank you.

Also specify the exact environment where the issue occurs:

## Linux distro and version? x86 or ARM? 32-bit or 64-bit?

## Branch (cpp98/cpp11/cpp17) and version of muduo?

## Version of cmake, gcc and boost? (If not from distro.)
